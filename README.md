# SatPie
## SAT solver based on CDCL in Python
(Easy to Understand - Highly Commented Code)
Features:
1. Conflict Driven Clause Learning
2. Clever Heuristics - VSIDS
3. 2 - Literal watch advanced data structure
4. Random restarts with restart probability decay

### Status:
#### -> The correctness of the SAT Solver has been verified through some of the Benchmarks from various sources. 
#### -> The Solver performs excellently for variables â‰ˆ till 2000, even better than EduSat in some cases.
#### -> The performance starts degrading for very large instances which can be optimized further in future work by learned clause deletion and    Unique Implication Point based clause learning.
### -> Random Restart Probabilty can be adjusted to optimize performance for larger instances.
